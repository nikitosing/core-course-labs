## Task 1: Python Web Application

### Framework selection:

I've chosen Flak since it's the most popular framework for two last years ([source](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2022/python/)).

Useful features of Flask affected my choice:

- Lightweight and minimalist
- Easy to learn and use
- Modular designed framework
- Built-in dev server
- It's open source product
- Unit testing support

### Implemented best practices and followed code standards:

- Proper naming of endpoints

  `/time` - noun. And GET HTTP method stands for action name. No any verbs in endpoint name

- Using proper project structure:
  ```
  /api
    /model
      time.py
    /route
      time.py
    /schema
      time.py
    /service
      time.py
  ```
- Blueprints usage, which gives modularity of the application
- Use Marshmallow for serializing objects
- Use auto-swagger library
- Document the API
- Use `requirements.txt`

### Ensured quality

- via unit tests (`/test`)
  - `pytest`
- via manual testing
- via `flake8`
- via cspell
- via python extensions in IDE

### Testing

Some of best practices which was applied:

- Cover 100% of the functionality
- Use `pytest` framework
- Use fixtures (`client` defined in `test/conftest.py`)
